        <p>Australian Open boss Craig Tiley believes the public are just days away from finding out whether Novak
          Djokovic
          will play in the Australian Open.The world number one has continued the mystery over the last few months about
          his
          vaccination status, with his
          participation at the first major in 2022 up in the air. He was due to play in Sydney’s ATP Cup that began on
          January 1 but was a late withdrawal, adding further fuel to
          the fire. There have been unconfirmed reports that he is not vaccinated but will apply for a medical
          exemption,
          and Tiley
          says we’ll know before the week if Djokovic is coming to Melbourne.</p>

        <p>Nobody has won the Fans favorite award since 2002 except Federer. The last player to win the award other than
          Federer was Marat Safin, who won back to back awards in 2001 and 2002.

          Meanwhile Federer underwent yet another knee surgery in August and hence was ruled out of remainder of the
          season. He is currently in recovery and should be back training in March 2022. He had earlier said that even
          making a cut for Wimbledon isn’t realistic.20-time grand slam Roger Federer is probably the biggest name in
          tennis. He has globalized the sport like no other player since the last two decades and is clearly the most
          loved tennis player of all time. Latest, he was announced the 2021 Fans Favorite Singles player of the year
          for a record 19th time.<br>

          Interestingly, Federer won the award for the 19th consecutive time despite missing out of most of the 2021
          season. He made a comeback earlier this year in March at Doha after a double knee surgery in 2020. His best
          result of the season came at Wimbledon where he made it to the quarterfinals before losing to Hubert Hurkacz.
