          <p class="content-text">Some historians believe that tennis first originated in the Ancient Egypt. There is a
            general belief that the
            word ‘racket’ derives from the Arabic word ‘rakhat’, which means a ‘palm’. However, the most common point of
            view is that French monks started to play tennis in 11-12 centuries. Tennis started to develop into a
            professional sport from 1872, when the first lawn tennis club was established. Hoa Pereira, a Portuguese
            merchant, and doctors Wellesley Tomkins and Frederick Haynes played a Spanish game with the ball called
            ‘pelota’ on lawns of the Leamington resort. Later, the original rules for lawn tennis were secured (tennis
            on
            a lawn).</p>

          <p class="content-text">Although it is impossible to state a definite origin of this game, it is recognized
            that a British army officer Walter Clopton Wingfield invented rules for tennis, later calling it ‘lawn
            tennis’ in 1873. He had noticed a significant commercial potential of lawn tennis and patented the game,
            though he failed to justify its creation. Mr. Winfield said that he had borrowed the principles of the Greek
            game called “Sphairistike” (Greek for playing ball). However, many researchers believe that he just used the
            principles of popular English games - playing at courts, squash rackets, playing badminton outdoors. Very
            first tennis players preferred to call Wingfield’s game “tennis on the green”, because they would play
            tennis on a small, grassy lawn.</p>

          <p class="content-text">In the 20s when tennis started to bring much bigger profits, majority of the amateur
            players went professional. In the end of the 19th century tennis started to spread throughout English
            colonies, first Australia, and then further around the world. In the United States the rules for lawn tennis
            were constantly evolving until the 1991 when the USTA (United States Lawn Tennis Association) was
            established. The association has fixed the rules for lawn tennis and tournament procedures. Annual men’s
            single competitions were held in Newport under the aegis of the association (1881). The first women’s
            competition was organized in Philadelphia in 1887.</p>

          <p class="content-text">In the 1968 the championship was renamed into now well-known ‘US Open’ and set to be
            played in the national tennis center, NY. At the beginning of the 20th century Wimbledon and US Open were
            the largest tournaments at the time. In the 1968 a new era in tennis began with both amateur and
            professional players having a right to participate in large-scale competitions. In 1971 the Women’s Tennis
            Association – professional women’s tournament was established that ensured the same financial support for
            both men and women. Lawn tennis tournaments can easily compete with the popularity of the Olympic games,
            where tennis players have been participating since 1988.</p>
